## Introduction

JavaScript is a **loosely typed** or a **dynamic language**. That means you don't have to declare the type of a variable ahead of time. The type will get determined automatically while the program is being processed. That also means that you can have the same variable as different types:
```javascript
var foo = 42;    // foo is now a Number
var foo = 'bar'; // foo is now a String
var foo = true;  // foo is now a Boolean
```

### Data Types in JavaScript
The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

- Six data types that are primitives:

  - Boolean (`true` and `false`)
  - Null (invalid object or address has the value `null`)
  - Undefined (a variable that has not been assigned a value has the value `undefined`)
  - Number (integer and floating point values ranging from  -(2<sup>53</sup> -1) to (2<sup>53</sup> -1), +Infinity, -Infinity and NaN(not-a-number) )
  - String (Sequence of textual characters. Strings are immutable in JavaScript)
  - [Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) (new in ECMAScript 6)

- [Object](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp)

#### Arrays
JavaScript **Arrays** are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-key-ed properties and the 'length' property. Additionally, arrays inherit from Array.prototype which provides to them a handful of convenient methods to manipulate arrays like indexOf (searching a value in the array) or push (adding an element to the array), etc. This makes arrays a perfect candidate to represent lists or sets.

### How to Use
The easiest way to run and test the codes from this repository is to use [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) (I have checked my code using nodejs v6.5.0 in an Windows machine).

Install it in your machine and add it to your environment path so that it is accessible in terminal commands.

Then you can run a JavaScript file like this:
```javascript
node file.js
```

### ES6/ES2015 implementations
There are ES6 implementations of the Data Structures and Algorithms in their respective folders within a separate folder named `es6`.
Couple of things to notice here:
* There are no true **private properties** available in ES6 yet. So, in classes no [workarounds or hacks](http://2ality.com/2016/01/private-data-classes.html) used to implement private properties. There are several [proposals](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-private-state) and initiative ongoing to introduce it in ECMAScript. Hoping that would be done soon and we will then add it in our code.
* We tried to implement the data structures and some algorithms in separate modules so that they can be used independently in any other codes. While `import` is indeed [part of ES6](http://2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), it is unfortunately not yet supported by any native environments, Node or browser. Until the native support introduced the easy workaround is to stick with the old **CommonJS Module format**(Which is supported in NodeJS and as we [advised earlier to test our codes in NodeJS](#how-to-use), so we are sticking with it). The modules will be [exported using CommonJS Module format and imported by 'require'](http://openmymind.net/2012/2/3/Node-Require-and-Exports/).
Though there are other ways like `Babel`, `Rollup` etc., but that need some build configurations(And we don't want to make our codes more complicated). And at the end babel will convert the code to `require` and `module.exports` anyway.

### FAQ
- *Why you didn't use prototype methods in Objects?*

    => Well, we could've. But before argue on that, you might want to read [this nice article](https://www.thecodeship.com/web-development/methods-within-constructor-vs-prototype-in-javascript/). We chose to follow the philosophy described on that article. But still, you can easily rewrite the codes of this repository using 'prototypal methods' for your own use.
